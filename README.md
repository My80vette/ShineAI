# ShineAI
A completely localized LLM based application to answer questions about all steps of detailing the interior/exterior of vehicles from basic washing all the way to full on Paint Correction.

**Goal:**  
Create an application that can be used to help guide people through the various steps of car detailing, utilizing the knowledge I have gained through my Capstone Experience with the AI SME I helped architect for JPL, but doing the entire project as a solo developer. I will utilize a small, local LLM and store all of my documents within the application so I can limit development cost at the expense of application size. If successful, I will use Azure cloud services to utilize a more powerful LLM and have better context storage and retrieval. I expect the scope of the application to change as I dive further into development.  
**Technologies Used: (To Be Updated As I Develop)**  
Streamlit - Python library for developing basic UIs, with a focus on chat bots.  
**Resources for learning:**  
Google Gemini - Google's free LLM chat bot, useful for acting as an interactive tutor to guide me through basic development tasks.  
ClaudeAI - Anthropic's LLM application, useful for uploading multiple files for code breakdown and basic troubleshooting.
